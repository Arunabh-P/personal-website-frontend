      PROFESSIONAL <br /> SUMMARY
    </h2>
    <p className="font-normal text-justify">
      With a foundation in Mechanical Engineering, I pivoted to web development
      during the pandemic, where I turned a challenging situation into an
      opportunity for growth. Using YouTube and official documentation, I
      self-taught development, quickly gaining proficiency in modern web
      technologies. My journey led me to{' '}
      <span className="font-medium">Brototype</span>, where I sharpened my
      skills in MERN stack development, and soon after, I secured my first
      professional role as a Frontend Developer at{' '}
      <span className="font-medium">Codinoz Technologies</span>.
      <br />
      <br />
      Currently, as a Software Engineer at{' '}
      <span className="font-medium">Technopalette Solutions</span>, I specialize
      in React.js and Next.js, focusing on migrating and optimizing
      cross-platform, mobile-first web applications. I design responsive,
      user-centric interfaces, integrate APIs seamlessly, and troubleshoot
      performance issues to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience. My
      work also involves building reusable components, fostering scalability,
      and streamlining the development process.
      <br />
      <br />I thrive in collaborative, Agile environments and have a strong
      passion for learning new technologies and mentoring others. My diverse
      background and adaptability allow me to bring unique insights to the
      table, continuously striving to contribute to team success and deliver
      high-quality web solutions.
